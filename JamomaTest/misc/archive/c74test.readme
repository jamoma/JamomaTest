c74test.rb is a Ruby script that searches through the contents of 
our repository and launches test patches.  The test patches 
communicate with a UDP server embedded within the script.  Below 
is some pseudocode that approximates the algorithm:


	while we have not found all test patches
		find a test patch
		launch it
		receive results, wait for TEST_FINISHED_STRING
		send TERMINATE_MAX_STRING
	end


If you're in the knox/testing directory, the syntax for running 
the script is:
	ruby c74test.rb svnroot apppath [suffix1] [suffix2] ...

For example:
	ruby c74test.rb /trunk /sysbuild/Development/MaxMSP.app
	ruby c74test.rb /trunk /sysbuild/Development/MaxMSP.app .test.pat

where svnroot is the root of our Subversion trunk checkout folder, apppath is the Max 
app to use to launch the test patches.  The script will by default 
look for all patches with the 'test.pat' suffix, but if any 
optional suffix arguments are present it will instead search for 
those.  For instance, this Mac command line:
	ruby c74test.rb /knox /Applications/MaxMSP\ 4.6/MaxMSP.app .jitter.test.pat
	
would launch all files with the .jitter.test.pat extension.


SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. On Windows you have to install Ruby.  http://www.ruby-lang.org .  
Click on the big "Download Ruby" button.  Scroll down to the "Ruby 
on Windows" section and download the Ruby One-Click installer.  
Download and install.

2. On Mac you have to make sure you have the "buildtool" svn folder 
checked out, because we use the 'openandwait' program in there.
